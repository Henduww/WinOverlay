# WinOverlay
Uses the Win32 API to create a fullscreen, transparent overlay. (Only covers 1 monitor)

This overlay blocks clicks, meaning whatever it covers may not be accessed.
This is easily modifiable.

There is no protection against opening multiple overlays, meaning this has to be implemented by the user of this code.
